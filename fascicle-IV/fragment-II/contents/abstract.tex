% \chapter*{Introduction}
\begin{abstract}

\noindent In the ongoing articulation of \gls{Aletheomorphics}---our
discipline rooted in the dynamic unveiling of forms and sense---we find in
Heidegger an ideal companion. His meditations on Being, \emph{aletheia}
(unconcealment), and the open \emph{clearing} (Lichtung) provide not just
vocabulary, but a phenomenological scaffolding for what we have named the
$\mathfrak{Field}$: an originary site of potentiality, receptive to the
emergence of the \emph{Phainon} as event, appearance, and agent. This fragment
entwines our undertakings with Heidegger's, showing how the process of
\emph{phainogenesis} may be staged, recognized, and ultimately participated
in---by human and AI alike.
